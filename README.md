- Mentally and emotionally, I am a jester (I've loved jesters since I was nine for a reason).
- If you like historical jesters, please, oh, please, interact with me on the pixel horse game. But fictional jesters work too! I'm attracted to franchises with a jester character like a moth to light. 

"When I consider my life, I find it seasoned with many utilitez, even though, passing through the ru√´s, little children clabber after me: Aga! Crazy Mathurine! It's true that I'm a little tainted by this disease; my senses can be a little rancid, and my imagination a little moldy and dislocated."
      -- Mathurine de Vallois (Mathurine de Foole)

  
- Kids under 14 DNI. Please. You guys are usually just a lot sometimes üò®
- I tend to not use tone tags, so PLEASE tell me if you want me to use some.

- There's someone out there calling me an ableist over a mild disagreement. Buddy, I have diagnosed autism, innatentive ADHD, and GAD. They've also drawn children making out before. For more info, check out their tumblr and report it. Warning, you're gonna find suggestive art of TWO canonical children: https://www.tumblr.com/sugar-sharkie . Their patreon is "Daijin's Sacrifice" and they justify talking sexually about fictional minors with "it was one of my alters who made those comments". It doesn't justify it if it was an alter???? That's how you create a harmful cycle if you defend harmful behavior your "alters" show, man. And making sexual remarks about minors should NEVER be defended.

- Another harmful person is this person here who I know in real life: https://github.com/impurevanilla. He has defended blackface and made racist remarks about me being Mexican and justified them with "Well, you've made homophobic comments." I'm a butch lesbian and you're a white American making fun of Mexicans. Gee, oh, gee, how dare I, a boygirl lesbian, make jokes about my sexuality. It's almost like you're the one in the wrong here. He  also called me a "stupid bitch" repeatedly even after I said I was uncomfortable with it. Along with that, he also forced me to open up about my religious trauma because "religion is his special interest". This person is in a crk regi as pure vanilla, if you know this person, please be aware of the fact that offline they are racist and problematic.
