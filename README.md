        If you're here from the GC NEST and you stumbled upon me on pony town, please don't int with me, post a screenshot on the gc nest that you found me like I'm some cryptid, or anything. I haven't been on discord for a while and the reason I only used it was to be on that server. To be honest I've been doing better off that server. The role I played on that server wasn't me, in fact it was more unfamiliar to me than a stranger. It was uncomfortable for me too. I was some gross amalgamation I haphazardly put together to try to fit in because at that time, in real life I had no friends I could reach out to. I had just moved cities, and I was slowly losing contact with my friendgroup. When I found myself online, in a server filled with strangers that could potentially offer me that same joy I had once felt in real life, I got excited. And as per usual I began to sew up a new costume that would let me fit in. Every bit I based off an aspect of everyone, hoping that I could be part of a group that I felt like a foreigner in, no matter how much I tried to change. You guys were all great. To me it's like an entire stranger was on that server, one who is worthy of being poked at because, yeah, even I wince when I think about how I acted. While I do hope I had been reached out to before I was thrown out so suddennly, there is no bitterness on my side. At most, I regret not being the real me on there and I'm sorry you guys had to deal with me for so long. And now that I'm off that server, I've been focusing on my real-life friends again and to be honest, things are going so much better now. I had fun and the reason I unfriended everyone wasn't because of some shipping dispute, but because I wanted to move on and getting kicked from the server opened my eyes to a door I needed to pass in order to move on from that dark time I was going through. There is no bitterness involved.

        So in essence, I’m not that person anymore, and thank god. I just ask that you all respect that I’ve moved on just as I've respected you guys' wishes, and please understand where I am coming from when I say this. I wish you all well, but I’m done with that part of my life.
