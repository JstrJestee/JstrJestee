  Also, also, I tend to not use tone tags and I get kind of annoyed when someone over uses them with me just because I'm, y'know, autistic. Still, if you need me to use tone tags, PLEASE tell me. I know not everyone with autism is like me on regards to tone tags so PLEASE tell me if you need me to use tone tags since I tend to be very, very sarcastic, and English not being my first language can often times lead to miscommunications COUGH. Working on that!!!!!!
