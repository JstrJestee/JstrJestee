        = Do not infantilize me just because I have autism, GAD, and ADHD, please. (I say this because people overuse tone tags just because of my autism, overexplain simple things, and if I go quiet for just a second people ask if I'm okay due to my GAD. I appreciate the concern but it really feels like I'm being treated like a cry-baby kid who can't do anything) I do not use tone tags a lot either, so please tell me if you need me to use them since I tend to be very sarcastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        = Kids under 14 DNI. You guys are somehow more inappropriate and dirty-minded than most 16+ people, it's ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
        = I'm very hesitant to talk with Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss/Dandy's World fans. Only reason I don't have the fandoms on my DNI list is because of friends, but even so, I keep my distance from strangers who like the franchsises.
      </p>
      <p>
        = Proshippers DNI. I hate how proshippers always say "it's fiction not reality" as an excuse. It entirely ignores how people have genuine trauma from the incest and pedophilia you actual degenerates romantisize. It's repulsive and selfish and you people are the reason why fandoms are such dangerous places for people who have gone through this sort of stuff. Fiction is meant to reflect some form of reality retold in a different form. You piteous lumps of writhing flesh just can't differentiate between familial love and romantic love because you likely never got hugged by any of your parents and, by god, does it show.
      </p>
      <p>
        = I've loved jesters since I was 9. Not just historical jesters but fictional too! I'm attracted to any franchise with a jester character in it like a moth to light So please talk to me about jesters. Just don't call jesters "clowns" because I might correct you. (Clowns and jesters are two different people)
      </p>
      <p>
        = People who sexualize lesbians or gays, DNI. This includes fujoshis and whatever their male counterpart is. My sexuality should not be your fetish.

Also entirely off topic, someone I know irl who goes to my school has made racist comments towards me (I'm brown and Mexican) and justifies them with "well, you've made homophobic comments before" (I'm a lesbian who made fun of her own sexuality and this person is white and American making fun of my race and nationality). Same person defended blackface saying it's not bad if done in private (So you're saying it's okay to be racist in private so no one gets mad at you????). https://github.com/cemeterycollective?tab=followers. This is their github, so beware if you're approached by someone who has this github. I might post on here their typical pony town style so people can beware more. They're in a couple of regis, and I'm trying to get in contact with them to tell them they've let in someoene who is problematic irl.
