I'm attracted to any franchise with a jester character in it like a moth to light So please talk to me about jesters. Just don't call jesters "clowns" because I might correct you. (Clowns and jesters are two different people)

--Historical or fictional, the role of a jester is to blur the line between comedy and truth, otherwise what's the point of making them wear a motley. I'm looking at you, Fizzarolli Helluva Boss. L jester design. Should have made him look like a CLOWN, not a jester. He doesn't do anything the titular jester archetype is supposed to do apart from being funny and rude. Should have made him a clown since that's more accurate--
