        If you're here from the gc nest and you stumbled upon me on pony town, please don't int with me or anything, really. I haven't been on discord for a while and the only reason I only used it was to be on that server. I knew I was gonna get kicked at some point and to be honest I've been doing better off that server. The role I was playing on there didn't suit me. It was uncomfortable for me too. All the jokes and comments I made weren't me, they were some gross amalgamation I haphazardly put together to try to fit in because in real life I had no friends I could reach out to. I had just moved away, and I was slowly losing contact with my friendgroup. When I found myself in a server filled with, frankly, strangers, I got excited. And as per usual I began to sew up a new costume that would let me fit in. Every bit a based off an aspect of everyone. I am sorry for the way things ended and the way I had caused it. You guys were all great, and whatever you guys are saying about me right now doesn't bother me because the Jesteeve you all knew was nowhere near the actual me. To me it's like an entire stranger was on that server.
