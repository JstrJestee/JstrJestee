        = Do not infantilize me just because I have autism, GAD, and ADHD, please. (I say this because people overuse tone tags just because of my autism, overexplain simple things, and if I go quiet for just a second people ask if I'm okay due to my GAD. I appreciate the concern but it really feels like I'm being treated like a cry-baby kid who can't do anything) I do not use tone tags a lot either, so please tell me if you need me to use them since I tend to be very sarcastic.

      <p>= The person here is someone I know in real life who goes to my school and has made racist comments towards me (I'm brown and Mexican) and justifies them with "well, you've made homophobic comments before" (I'm a lesbian who made fun of my own sexuality and this person is white and American making fun of my race and nationality).</p>
      <p>= Made fun of my accent (English is not my first language and while I do encourage people to correct my grammar and pronunciation mistakes, it does not mean you can mock my accent. There is a stark difference).</p>
      <p>Also defended blackface saying it's not bad if done in private or if "not meant to be insulting".</p>
      <p>Called me a bitch repeatedly even after I asked him to stop.</p>
      <p>He keeps changing his github to run away from me linking him to any document me or my friends make to call him out. So I've put one of his ponies here. He has the same tinting style for all his ponies (minimal shading with purple tint) Beware if you are approached by someone who looks like this. He is in many regis and I'm trying to get in contact with them to inform them of the harm this person has done.</p>
