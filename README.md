"When I consider my life, I find it seasoned with many amenities, even though, passing through the streets, little children clamor after me: Aga! Crazy Mathurine! It's true that I'm a little tainted by this disease; my senses may be a little rancid, and my imagination a little moldy and shattered."
      -- Mathurine de Vallois (Mathurine la Foole)

- There's someone out there calling me an ableist over a mild disagreement. Buddy, I have diagnosed autism, innatentive ADHD, and GAD. They've also drawn children making out before. For more info, check out their tumblr and report it. Warning, you're gonna find suggestive art of TWO canonical children: https://www.tumblr.com/sugar-sharkie . Their patreon is "Daijin's Sacrifice" and they justify talking sexually about fictional minors with "it was one of my alters who made those comments". It doesn't justify it if it was an alter???? That's how you create a harmful cycle if you defend harmful behavior your "alters" show, man. And making sexual remarks about minors should NEVER be defended.

- Another harmful person is this person here who I know in real life: https://github.com/impurevanilla. He has defended blackface and made racist remarks about me being Mexican and justified them with "Well, you've made homophobic comments." I'm a butch lesbian and you're a white American making fun of Mexicans. Gee, oh, gee, how dare I, a boygirl lesbian, make jokes about my sexuality. It's almost like you're the one in the wrong here. He  also called me a "stupid bitch" repeatedly even after I said I was uncomfortable with it. Along with that, he also forced me to open up about my religious trauma because "religion is his special interest". This person is in a crk regi as pure vanilla, if you know this person, please be aware of the fact that offline they are racist and problematic. UPDATE: he changed his Github because he knew I called him out on his bullshit. I have his strawpage right here: https://livingundead.straw.page/. Buddy says he'll credit all the stolen art in their strawpage but it's been a month. There hasn't been any credits. Art stealer AND a racist.
